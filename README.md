# :electron: openPMD-Resampler
Resampling tools for `openPMD` PIC data

## :bulb: Motivation

We often need to post-process the particle data from a PIC simulation, and pass it to additional tracking codes like [`GEANT`](#atom_symbol-geant4), [`GPT`](https://www.pulsar.nl/gpt/), [`SIMION`](https://simion.com) or [`Wake-T`](https://github.com/AngelFP/Wake-T). The original dataset can correspond to several **billion** particles, so one needs to reduce it to a manageable size, while conserving the main features of the underlying physics. This repository implements several resampling methods from the literature [[2]](#books-references), as well as a comprehensive suite of high-resolution [visualization](./plots/phase_space.png) tools, based on [Datashader](https://datashader.org).

## :rocket: Installation

We make use of the excellent [pixi](pixi.sh) package manager, which can be installed on Linux/macOS via

```console
$ curl -fsSL https://pixi.sh/install.sh | bash
```

One can then clone this repo via 

```console
$ git clone git@github.com:berceanu/openPMD-resampler.git
```

## :book: Usage

For an overview of the main functionality, see the [`usage.py`](./usage.py) example script and its [output](./output.md).
For production runs, use

```console
$ cd openPMD-resampler
$ pixi run start --opmd_path <path_to_your_openPMD_file> --species <particle_species_name> --mass <particle mass> --reduction_factor <k>
```

Replace descriptions between chevrons `<>` by relevant values, in this case the
path to the PIC output file, name of the particle species (`e_all` or
`e_highGamma` etc.), particle mass relative to the electron mass (default: 1.0) (1.0 for electron, 1836.152 for proton, or 22033.824 for carbon etc.), and an integer reduction factor `k`, typically between 2 and ~100.
If the initial PIC file has `N` macroparticles, the resulting reduced file will have `N/k`
macroparticles.

If you need a sample PIC output file for testing, you can download [lwfa.h5](https://transfer.sequanium.de/qjhu1I2t56/lwfa.h5) [212M].

The code works with `openPMD`-compatible PIC codes, such as [`WarpX`](https://github.com/ECP-WarpX/WarpX), [`PIConGPU`](https://github.com/ComputationalRadiationPhysics/picongpu), [`fbpic`](https://github.com/fbpic/fbpic), etc.

The runtime is typically a few minutes and the memory footprint is about twice the size of the input file.

The output is a CSV text file, of the following form:

```
position_x_um (μm), position_y_um (μm), position_z_um (μm), momentum_x_mev_c (MeV/c), momentum_y_mev_c (MeV/c), momentum_z_mev_c (MeV/c)

## :wrench: Development

All project dependencies are listed under [`pixi.toml`](pixi.toml).
Just create a fork, follow the install instructions and start making PRs.

## :atom_symbol: GEANT4

For a computational estimate, here is a quote from Ref. [1]:

> The computer system for [`GEANT4`](https://geant4.web.cern.ch) simulation is made up of Intel Quad-core 2.66 GHz CPU and 12 GB DDR3 RAM and OS is Ubuntu 9.04 server version. It took about 3~4 hours to simulate with $10^7$ primary particles.
